At patientslikeme.com we have an automated build.  Sometimes it breaks but eventually it gets fixed.  When it breaks we want to know about our fail in more than plain text.  When it is fixed, we want to be encouraged by asinine images.

To contribute, fork and add to config/fail.txt or config/win.txt accordingly and send a pull request.  Let's keep it jpgs for now.

Some images may feature profanity and/or mocking of juggalos.  You have been warned.

You can see the app in action at http://build-macros.heroku.com/
