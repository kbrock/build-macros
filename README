At patientslikeme.com we have a build.  Sometimes it breaks but eventually it gets fixed.  when it breaks we want to know about our fail in more than plain text.  When it fixes, we want to be encouraged by asinine images.

To contribute, fork and add to config/fail.txt or config/win.txt accordingly and send a pull request.

Some images may feature profanity and/or mocking of juggalos.  You have been warned.
